A mosfet optimizer

This optimizer contains 2 modes: a bruteforce tester and a equation based optimizer

Bruteforce
The bruteforce method tests different input variables and analyzes the output to find a optimium solution.

Equation
The equation based optimizer parses the netlists and derives EKV equations for each measurement.
Then the equation system is solved using octave and verified using ngspice.

Additional software used:
Octave, ngspice, gnuplot
